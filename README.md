# Twitter analysis into the Dutch elections of 2021

As social media continues to play an increasingly key role in everyday life, more people openly discuss their political opinions online. Harvesting this data for social research results in unprecedented insights in public opinion. Data collection on such a large scale is something that was not possible before and has lead to new issues arising as larger amounts of data become available.

Although there is a growing body of research on predicting electoral outcomes with Twitter data (Yaqub et al., 2020), others (like Gayo-Avello, 2013) have criticized the representativeness of tweets and its predictive ability. Wetstein (2016) mentions two methods of electoral tweet prediction: a straight forward method of counting tweets that mention a certain party, where it is found that this number reflects the election outcome. A more nuanced method makes use of sentiment analysis and generally provides better results.

This research aims to give insight in the ability of Twitter data to reflect on and predict electoral outcomes. It does so by focusing on the sentiments and spatial distribution of tweets in regard to party popularity in the week leading up to the Dutch parliamentary elections of 2021 and comparing the found patterns with the actual outcomes.  

Three key research questions were formulated from the aims of this project, those being the following:
    What are the spatial patterns in the tweets?
    What are the sentiments of the tweets?
    How do the tweets relate to the outcome of the election?

The final results of this project are discussed and visualized in the following [StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c09bda1912464431b43bd8bc5fc7de40).
